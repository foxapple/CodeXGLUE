# Thoughts:
#
# This is a twisted application protocol base class that has been tailored to
# work with drone.application, droned.services.application and
# the DroneD server.  This protocol is consumed by drone.clients.command which
# is a ClientCreator extenstion that wraps reactor.spawnProcess.  This protocol
# isn't very useful by itself, but it does demonstrate how to create
# 'application model plugin protocols'.  This is one of the most important
# design blocks that makes DroneD generic enough to fit your needs, but verbose
# enough to get some real work done.

class ApplicationProtocol(protocol.ProcessProtocol):
    """This is the protocol base class for application model derived plugins

       AppProtocols are tied to application models 'drone.models.application',
       the application model will pass the AppProtocol to the command processor
       'drone.clients.__init__.command'.  The AppProtocol is responsible for
       running the command to completion and firing the err/callbacks.  On 
       invocation of the callbacks a dictionary should be passed, format
       below.  On invocation of the errbacks a Failure() should be passed.
       The AppProtocol 'MUST' accept 'deferredResult' as the last '*arg' to
       the constructor, this is not optional and undefined behaviour will occur
       if you miss this.  The deferredResult is used for err/callbacks.

      
       !!!you should return the following data in your callbacks 
       callback dict: {'code' : "The Exit Code", 'pid' : "Process ID", ...}
