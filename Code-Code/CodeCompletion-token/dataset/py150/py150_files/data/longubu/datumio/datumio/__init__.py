"""
datumio: Real-time augmentation of data for inputs into deep learning models.
==================================
Datumio is a data loader with real-time augmentation, specifically tailored
for inputs into image-based deep learning models (CNN).

Datumio is an aggregation of other existing open source projects
(specifically kaggle-plankton, kaggle-galaxy-zoo, keras-preprocessing-image)
with hopes that it is simple and general enough to be used with any framework,
from keras to caffe.
