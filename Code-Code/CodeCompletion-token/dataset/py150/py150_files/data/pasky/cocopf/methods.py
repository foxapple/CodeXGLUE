"""
A minimization method (optimization algorithm) interface that allows
per-iteration stepped access to various optimizers, referred to by
their name as a string.

By default, this wraps around the SciPy optimizers and the reference
CMA-ES Python implementation by N. Hansen (if you installed it).  In the
future, we will probably add even more optimizers.  However, if you want
to add some optimizers locally, this class is designed to be subclassed
for precisely that purpose.

All in all, these minimization method names are recognized:

    * CMA, IPOP-CMA, BIPOP-CMA: The CMA algorithm.  IPOP and BIPOP are
      some specific restart strategies that enhance performance; especially
      BIPOP will make CMA quite universally great across the BBOB benchmark.

      `pip install cma` to get the module, otherwise you will get an
      exception when you try to use it.  For BIPOP, you will need either
      some very new cma version or on your own apply our patch from

            http://pasky.or.cz/dev/scipy/cma-1.1.02-bipop.patch

    * Nelder-Mead, Powell, CG, BFGS, L-BFGS-B, TNC, SLSQP (as of SciPy 0.13.3;
      as other minimizers appear in SciPy, they will work automatically).
      These are local searches; the so.minimize call is wrapped in
      so.basinhopping which provides an intelligent restart strategy.

      Note that some SciPy minimizers (not listed above) are not supported
      since they are not black-box but require at least function derivations.
      COBYLA is not supported as it (yet?) does not implement a callback
      functionality.

class MinimizeMethod(object):
    """
    A specific minimization method initialized  with regard to a specific
    benchmarked function (that could influence some of the parameters, etc.).
    The object is a callable that, when called, should start the minimization
    method (see ``__call__`` description below).

    Attributes:
        ``name``: Provided name of the method.
        ``fi``: Provided FInstance object describing the benchmark function.
        ``outer_loop``: A method to be used as a minimizer callable.
            Typically, this would be a global minimization routine with
            a calling convention similar to `scipy.optimize.basinhopping`;
            if that doesn't suit you, provide a wrapper lambda or override
            the ``__call__`` method as well.
        ``minimizer_kwargs``: The minimizer parameters.

    Example:

    >> m = MinimizeMethod("BFGS", fi)
    >> m(lambda x: np.sum(x ** 2), x0, inner_cb = callback)

    You are expected to inherit this class if you want to allow other methods
    than those that are part of scipy.  The recommended way is to override the
    _set_method() method to parse the provided name and in case of a match,
    reconfigure the callable.  If you want to use the stock scipy basinhopping
    outer_loop, you will need scipy version 0.14 or newer to be able to pass
    a callable instead of a string as the `method` argument.

    Note that even though this interface is designed to perform global
    minimization, it may sometimes terminate early outside of global optimum
    and you should plan your experiments to restart it in that case.
