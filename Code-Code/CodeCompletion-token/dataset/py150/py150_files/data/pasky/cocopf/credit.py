"""
Management of "credits" assigned to method population members, that can
then be used for method choice - accrued credits determine fitness of
the members. (We are still minimizing the credit, i.e. smaller is better.)

Credit assignment mostly involves rescaling raw results to a [0,1]
interval - either working with the fitness itself or just its rank
(sorted position) within the population.

Credit accrual can commonly be simply resetting credit of the whole
population - keeping no history and instead choosing just based on
the last result.  Alternatively, it can be a simple average, window
based average, exponential back-off, etc.

To use the credits infrastructure, simply maintain a PopulationCredit
instance together with Population and choose based on
popcredit.credit[i] instead of pop.values[i]. Consider allowing
the user to override the method names.

XXX: Warning, note that the credits infrastructure is still experimental
and particularly the assign/accrual method API can change yet.
We need to allow history-based credit, be it simply improvement metric
or a larger history window support. We could do that by adding a reward
history to Population as well, though.
