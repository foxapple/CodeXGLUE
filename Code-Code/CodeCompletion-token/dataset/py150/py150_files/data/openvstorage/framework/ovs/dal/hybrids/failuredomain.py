    The FailureDomain class represents a domain where DTL and/or volumedriver MDS services can be configured to
     Eg:
     || Storage Router || Failure Domain || Backup Failure Domain ||
     |        sr1       |       fd1       |          fd2           |

     |        sr3       |       fd2       |          fd1           |

      - Storage router 1 is part of failure domain 1 and backup failure domain 2
      - Storage router 2 is part of failure domain 1 and backup failure domain 2
      - Storage router 3 is part of failure domain 2 and backup failure domain 1
      - Storage router 4 is part of failure domain 2 and backup failure domain 1

      Storage router 1 will have its DTL configured within its own failure domain (by default), which means on storage router 2

      Each storage router CAN also have a backup failure domain
      For storage router 1 this will be backup failure domain 2 and for storage router 4 this will be backup failure domain 1
      If storage router 2 would go down, the backup failure domain will be used, which means storage router 3 and storage router 4 can be used for DTL of storage router 1
