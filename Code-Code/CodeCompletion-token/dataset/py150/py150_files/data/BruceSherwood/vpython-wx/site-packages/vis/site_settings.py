## Disabling shaders may be necessary on some systems where Visual fails
## to detect that the video hardware or drivers are incapable of competently
## rendering the shaders used to implement certain materials.  This will
## revert all objects to legacy rendering regardless of what material is
## chosen:

enable_shaders = True # Make False to disable shaders

## Alternatively, it might be possible to fix some systems by disabling
## only some materials, remapping them to ones that work:

##from visual_common import materials
##materials.rough = materials.marble
