README on quality metrics

AsSignal - classified as signal
IsBackgroundAsSignal - background, but classified as signal

There are many ways to denote this things

README on flatness

this metrics are unfortunately more complicated than usual ones
and require more information: not only predictions and classes,
but also mass (or other variables along which we want to hav uniformity)

Here we compute the different metrics of uniformity of predictions:

SDE  - the standard deviation of efficiency
Theil- Theil index of Efficiency (Theil index is used in economics)
KS   - based on Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance between distributions
CVM  - based on Cramer-von Mises similarity between distributions
