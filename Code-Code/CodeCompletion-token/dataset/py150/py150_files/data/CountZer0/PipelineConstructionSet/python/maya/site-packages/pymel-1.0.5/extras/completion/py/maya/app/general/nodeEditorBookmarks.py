"""
Bookmarks are saved using the special nodes hyperGraphInfo, hyperView and hyperLayout.

Each Node Editor Bookmark is represented by a hyperGraphInfo which stores the bookmark info, and which is connected to at least one hyperView.  The hyperView stores one view state and is linked to one hyperLayout.  The hyperLayout stores the graph state, including the state of each individual node in the scene.
