PyMoBu

An enhancement for Autodesk's MotionBuilder Python implementation.
PyMoBu offers stronger and more user-friendly object classes and
functions that wrap around existing MotionBuilder objects.

It is easy to convert your existing object to a PyMoBu one by
calling the 'ConvertToPyMoBu' method on that object.

Supported MB versions:
