#   "Part of the art of software development is having a good sense of what is
#   likely to change as time goes on, and what isn't. For the stuff that is
#   likely to change, use the interfaces and other SOLID concepts.
#   For the stuff that won't, use YAGNI and just pass concrete types,
#   forget the factory classes, forget all the runtime hooking up and
#   configuration, etc, and forget a lot of the SOLID abstractions.
#   In my experience, the YAGNI approach has proven to be correct
#   far more often than it is not."
