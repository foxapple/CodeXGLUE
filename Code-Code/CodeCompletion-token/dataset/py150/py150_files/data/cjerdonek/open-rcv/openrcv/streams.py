"""Exposes core stream-related functionality.

A "stream resource" is a core concept used throughout this project.
This module exposes many stream resource implementations.

A stream resource can be viewed as a generalization of a file path:
it can be opened for reading to yield a readable stream, or opened for
writing to yield a writeable stream.  It is more general than a file
because the stream can contain any objects and not just lines of text.
Also, the backing store for a stream resource can be something other
than a file.  For example, it can be backed by a container object like
a list or an in-memory text stream like an io.StringIO object.

Stream resources can also be written to transform data when reading and
writing from a stream.  For example, a stream resource can parse the lines
of a ballot file or serialize a ballot to text.  In this case, the caller
only interacts with the deserialized data.  The stream resource takes
care of the rest.


API
---

A stream resource must implement two methods, reading() and writing(), that
each return a with-statement context manager [1].  In both cases, entering
the context manager opens the stream, and exiting closes the stream.

For the reading() method, the context manager must yield an iterator object
for the target `as` expression, in the same way that calling the built-in
function `open(path)` yields an iterator object over the lines of a file.
Here is a typical example of reading from a stream resource named `resource`:

    with resource.reading() as gen:
        for item in gen:
            # Do stuff.
            ...

Similarly, for the writing() method, the context manager must yield
a writeable stream for the target `as` expression.  Here is a typical
example of writing to a stream resource:

    with resource.writing() as gen:
        for item in items:
            gen.write(item)
            ...

The semantics of the reading() and writing() methods closely resemble those
of the built-in function open() (with modes "r" and "w", respectively).


Advantages
----------

Encapsulating data as a stream resource has several advantages.
First and foremost, it simplifies our high-level code.  Stream resources
let us write high-level code that is independent of whether the stream is
backed by a file on disk or in memory as an in-memory text stream
or container.  For example, this lets us easily write unit tests that
use in-memory structures as opposed to writing to disk.

Moreover, in the case of files especially, stream resources let us write
code that is blind to what particular serialization format is being used.
For example, ballot-counting code can deal with ballots independent of
how they are being stored or serialized.  For example, the same code can
be used whether the ballots are being read from a BLT-formatted file
or a WinEDS-formatted file.

In addition, stream resources let us postpone the opening of files for
clearer file-handle management.  For example, instead of opening a stream
early and passing the open stream into an API, a stream resource can be
passed into the API, and the API's implementation can open the stream
(e.g. using `with resource.reading() as stream`).  This pattern also
lets us iterate over large sets of ballots without having to store
them in memory all at once.

    A stream resource is an object that encapsulates a stream that can
    be opened for reading or writing.  The backing store for the stream
    can be something like a file or an iterable like a list.

    Normally, the __init__() constructor accepts a reference to the stream
    backing store.

    TODO: clean up the below.

    An instance of this class is a context manager factory function
    for managing the resource of an iterable of ballots.

    An instance of this class could be used as follows, for example:

        with ballot_resource() as ballots:
            for ballot in ballots:
                # Handle ballot.
                ...

    This resembles the pattern of opening a file and reading its lines.
    One reason to encapsulate ballots as a context manager as opposed to
    an iterable is that ballots are often stored as a file.  Thus,
    implementations should really support the act of opening and closing
    the ballot file when the ballots are needed (i.e. managing the file
    resource).  This is preferable to opening a handle to a ballot
    file earlier than needed and then keeping the file open.
