# Stock initial conditions and derivative functions are given leading underscores not because
# we specifically want them to be private to PySD, but because they have to exist in the same
# namespace as other model components, which for all we know, might have similar names. We know
# that no element from Vensim will have a leading underscore, however, as Vensim won't allow it,
#  so this is a reasonable way to make them 'safe'.

# The 'init' needs to be a function in its own right (as opposed to just an attribute of the stock
# accessor) because its expression may reference other parts of the model. We want the initialization
# to happen at run-time, not import-time, so we need to defer execution.
