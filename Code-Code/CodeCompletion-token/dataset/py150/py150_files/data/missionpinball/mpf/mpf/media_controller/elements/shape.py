    Args:
        slide: The Slide object this animation is being added to.
        machine: The main machine object.
        shape: The name of the shape you'd like to draw. See notes below.
        x: The horizontal position offset for the placement of this element.
        y: The vertical position offset for the placement of this element.
        h_pos: The horizontal anchor.
        v_pos: The vertical anchor.
        **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments which vary depending on the shape
            you're drawing.

    Note: Full documentation on the use of the x, y, h_pos, and v_pos arguments
    can be found at: https://missionpinball.com/docs/displays/display-elements/positioning/

    Shapes options:

    box: Draws a box.

    Additional keywords:
        width: The width of the box.
        height: The height of the box.
        thickness: How many pixels thick you want the box to be. A value of 0
            means the box will be filled in solid.

    line: Draws a line.

    Additional keywords:
        start_x, start_y: The coordinates of the starting point.
        end_x, end_y: The coordinates of the ending point.
        thickness: How many pixels thick you want the line to be.
