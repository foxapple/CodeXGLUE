    Calculates Euclidean distances to the first K closest elements of y
    for each x, which are row-instance data matrices.

    Returns a matrix whose (i, j)th element is the distance from the ith point
    in x to the (j+1)th nearest neighbor in y.

    If return_indices, also returns a matrix whose (i, j)th element is the
    identity of the (j+1)th nearest neighbor in y to the ith point in x.

    FLANN returns squared Euclidean distances of the same type as the input
    data. If dist_double, if results are float32, cast them to float64 before
    square-rooting for more numerical accuracy.

    By default, clamps minimum distance to min(1e-2, 1e-100 ** (1/dim));
    setting min_dist to a number changes this value. Use 0 for no clamping.

    If index is passed, uses a preconstructed FLANN index for the elements of y
    (a FLANN() instance where build_index() has been run). Otherwise, constructs
    an index here and then deletes it, using the passed algorithm. By default,
    uses a single k-d tree for data with dimension 5 or lower, and brute-force
    search in higher dimensions (which give exact results). Any other keyword
    arguments are also passed to the FLANN() object.
