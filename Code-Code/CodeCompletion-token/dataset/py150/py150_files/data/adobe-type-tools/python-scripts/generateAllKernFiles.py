writeTrimmed = False    # If 'False', trimmed pairs will not be processed and, therefore, will not be written to the kerning feature file.
writeSubtables = True   # Sometimes the kerning feature file needs to have explicit subtable breaks, otherwise the OTF won't compile due to a subtable overflow.

This script takes a path to a folder as input, finds all the UFOs inside that folder

If a path is not provided, the script uses the current path as the top-most directory.
