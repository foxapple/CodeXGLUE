class OnChange(object):
    """ A record filter that checks if the record field has changed.

    A copy of the field value is stored in the object and compared against new
    values. On value changed the object returns True.

    Attributes
    ----------
    field : str
        The field to check for change.

    previous :
        Holds the value of the field.

    Notes
    -----
    - Filters and recorders can be shared between monitors. The filter however
      is not aware of ownership so use with care when sharing the same
      instance.
    - This filter only works with nametuple like records.
