# default location for the backdoor commands here to hastily bludgeon data
# into. How did we find it? Guesswork! Also, staring at memsquares!

# This is halfway through DRAM, in a spot that seems to exhibit uninitialized
# memory patterns even after quite a lot of time running memsquare.py
# Hopefully our code won't get trashed by a SCSI packet!
